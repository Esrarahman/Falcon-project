<h1>Team History</h1>
<p>
Atlanta Falcons, American professional Football  team based in Atlanta that plays in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL). The Falcons have won two NFC championships (1999 and 2017).
</p>
<p>
The Falcons began play in 1966 as an expansion team, and they lost at least 11 of their 14 games in each of their first three seasons. The team slowly improved through the late 1960s and early ’70s to post a 9–5 record in 1973 behind a defense led by linebacker Tommy Nobis and defensive end Claude Humphrey, narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the process.
</p>
<p>
In 1999 the Falcons would beat the Minnesota Vikings 30-27 to make it to their first ever superbowl. In the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017, they defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions. This would be their second, and latest, superbowl appearance in franchise history.
